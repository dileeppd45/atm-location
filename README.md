ATM-Nearby
The project ATM Nearby is a software application designed to help users find available ATMs nearby based on their needs. Users can search for ATMs according to branches and locations. The software has three Interface: the user interface, the branch interface, and the admin interface.

User Interface: Users can register, log in, and view available ATMs based on their search criteria, such as branches or specific locations.

Branch Interface: Branches can register and add their ATMs to the platform, including details such as location and the current status of each ATM (available or not available). Branches also have the ability to update the status of their ATMs in real-time, ensuring that users receive accurate information. Additionally, branches can manage their personal data securely, such as passwords.

Admin Interface: Administrators manage and control the software. They have the authority to approve or reject registration requests from branches. Once approved, branches can add their corresponding ATMs and update their information.

Users need to register on the platform before accessing information about ATMs. Branches also need to register and await approval from the admin before they can add and manage their ATM details. This ensures that only verified branches can update ATM statuses, providing users with accurate and reliable information.
